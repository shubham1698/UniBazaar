## Summary of Work Done in Sprint 3

### 1. **Products Pagination Support**
   - **Implemented Pagination for Product Listings:** 
     - Added pagination capabilities to the product retrieval logic, which helps in handling large data sets efficiently. Introduced a fast pipeline and aggregation method that fetches products using two key parameters sorted by `ProductId`:
       - `lastID`: Allows fetching products after a specific product ID, facilitating continuous product retrieval.
       - `limit`: Restricts the number of products fetched at a time, optimizing performance and reducing memory usage.
     - This pagination mechanism ensures that users can seamlessly browse through products without overwhelming the system or frontend, even when the number of products increases significantly.
   - **Updated Methods:** 
     - Modified the `GET products/` and `GET products/{userId}/` endpoints to include the `lastID` and `limit` query parameters.

### 2. **Product Search Endpoint**
   - **Implemented Product Search:** 
     - Introduced a search functionality for products, allowing users to query products based on specific terms in the product title and description. This is achieved using a fast pipeline and aggregation method with MongoDB's full-text search capabilities. The search supports two key parameters:
       - `query`: The search query used to match products based on their title and description.
       - `limit`: Restricts the number of products fetched at a time, optimizing performance and reducing memory usage.
     - The search logic utilizes MongoDB’s aggregation pipeline to perform a full-text search across the `ProductTitle` and `ProductDescription` fields, and it returns matching products in a fast and efficient manner.
   - **Updated Endpoints:**
     - Added the `GET /search/products` endpoint to handle product searches, allowing users to search products by query and limit the results. 

### 3. **Custom Error Handling**
   - **Introduced Custom Error Handling:**
     - Implemented a custom error structure to streamline error handling across the application. The new error handling system includes several error types to represent specific error cases:
       - **NotFoundError**: Represents cases where a resource is not found (e.g., no products matching a search query).
       - **DatabaseError**: Represents database-related errors.
       - **S3Error**: Represents errors encountered during interactions with Amazon S3 or other storage solutions.
       - **BadRequestError**: Represents client-side errors due to invalid input or bad requests.
     - Each error type provides a consistent structure with the ability to store an error message, status code, and underlying cause, making it easier to track and respond to errors.

   - **Updated Response Handling:**
     - Refined error response handling to return appropriate status codes and error messages based on the custom error types. The `HandleError` function now processes errors with custom logic to determine the status code, message, and error details.
     - The success response handler (`HandleSuccessResponse`) was also introduced to return successful responses in a consistent format with proper status codes and data serialization.
     - This ensures that all API responses, both error and success, are standardized and informative, improving the API's robustness and user experience.

### 4. **Products Page with Pagination and Load More**
   - **Paginated Listings:**
     - Developed a `ProductsPage` with a "Load More" button, fetching 12 products per request and using the `lastId` for pagination.
     - Implemented `useAllProducts` hook to track the last fetched product and avoid duplicates.
   
   - **Error Handling and Loading:**
     - Displayed a loading spinner when products are being fetched and showed a relevant error message if the request fails.
     - Added a fallback UI that allows the user to retry fetching products in case of an error.
   
   - **Efficient Data Fetching:**
     - Used `useRef` to track already fetched products and stop requests when all products are loaded.
     - Used conditional logic to stop making requests once all products have been fetched, providing a smooth browsing experience for users.

### 5. **JWT-Based Authentication**
- **Enhanced Security Measures:**  
  - Implemented robust JWT-based authentication for the backend.  
  - Introduced secure endpoints for:  
    - **User Login:** Issues access and refresh tokens upon successful authentication.  
    - **Token Validation:** Validates JWTs on protected routes to ensure session integrity.  
    - **Logout:** Revokes tokens and safely ends user sessions.  
  - Ensures each session is securely managed using tokens with unique identifiers, allowing precise control over session validity and user state.

### 6. **Enhanced Detailed Error Handling for Users**
- **Improved User-Focused Error Feedback:**  
  - Refined backend error handling to return more informative and actionable messages during user operations such as registration, login, and profile management.  
  - These enhancements simplify debugging and improve the overall user experience.

### 7. **Improved Login and Signup Workflow:**  
  - Refined the overall flow for user authentication to make the signup and login experience smoother and more intuitive.  
  - Handled edge cases more effectively to reduce potential errors and enhance reliability across various user scenarios.

## Design & Implementation Highlights

### 1. Password Hashing (Argon2id)
- We use **Argon2id** (via [alexedwards/argon2id](https://github.com/alexedwards/argon2id)) for secure password storage.
- Parameters:
  - **Memory**: 128 MB
  - **Iterations**: 4
  - **Parallelism**: Number of CPU cores
  - **SaltLength**: 16 bytes
  - **KeyLength**: 32 bytes
- **Why Argon2id?**  
  Argon2id is recommended by OWASP for modern password hashing. It is resistant to GPU-cracking attacks and provides configurable memory hardness.

### 2. Password Complexity
- Minimum **60 bits of entropy** enforced via [go-password-validator](https://github.com/wagslane/go-password-validator).
- If a password is too weak, the server returns an error indicating insufficient complexity.

### 3. Email Validation
- Only **.edu** domains from specific Florida universities are allowed to register (`ufl.edu`, `fsu.edu`, `ucf.edu`, etc.).
- If the domain is not recognized, the request is rejected.

### 4. Phone Validation
- Regex is used to ensure a valid US number with 10 digits, optionally prefixed by `+1` is being used.

### 5. One-Time Password (OTP) Verification for Email upon Registration
- Upon user registration, a 6-digit OTP is generated and sent to the user's registered email via SendGrid.
- The user must enter the correct OTP to complete the email verification process.
- If the OTP is incorrect or expired, verification will fail, and the user must request a new OTP.

### 6. One-Time Password (OTP) Verification for Forgot Password
- When a user initiates a password reset, a 6-digit OTP is generated and sent to their registered email.
- The user must enter the correct OTP to proceed with resetting their password.
- If the user enters an incorrect OTP three or more times, a security alert email is triggered, notifying them of suspicious activity.

### 7. Database (GORM)
- GORM is used to interact with the database.
- **User** model:
  ```go
  type User struct {
      UserID              int    `gorm:"column:userid;primaryKey" json:"userid"`
      Name                string `json:"name"`
      Email               string `json:"email"`
      Password            string `json:"-"`
      OTPCode             string `json:"-"`
      FailedResetAttempts int    `json:"-"`
      Verified            bool   `json:"-"`
      Phone               string `json:"phone"`
  }

# Appendix: Security & Design Choices

This section explains key security and design decisions behind the UniBazaar user authentication system.

## 1. Why Use SendGrid for Email Notifications?
SendGrid was chosen as the email provider for sending OTP codes and security alerts because:
- **Reliability:** SendGrid offers a scalable and highly available cloud-based email service.
- **Security:** It supports **DKIM, SPF, and TLS encryption**, ensuring secure email transmission.
- **Rate Limits & Throttling:** SendGrid provides rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., brute-force OTP requests).
- **Easy API Integration:** The SendGrid API is well-documented and integrates smoothly with Go-based backend services.
- **Monitoring & Analytics:** Logs and analytics help track email delivery rates and failures.

### Alternative Considerations
Other email services such as **AWS SES** and **Mailgun** were considered, but SendGrid was selected due to its **free tier for transactional emails** and superior developer tooling.

## 2. Why Use Argon2id for Password Hashing?
**Argon2id** is the recommended password hashing algorithm by OWASP and is used in UniBazaar due to:

- **Memory-Hardness:** Argon2id is resistant to GPU and ASIC-based brute force attacks due to its high memory requirements.
- **Customizable Parameters:** It allows tuning of memory, iterations, and parallelism for optimal security.
- **Resistance to Timing Attacks:** Unlike bcrypt, Argon2id provides protection against cache-timing attacks.

---

## 3. Password Entropy Enforcement (go-password-validator)

To enforce strong password security, UniBazaar uses `go-password-validator` with a **minimum entropy requirement of 60 bits**. This ensures that passwords are not easily guessable by:

- **Forcing Complexity:** Users must have a unique, hard to guess password.
- **Mitigating Dictionary Attacks:** Prevents users from choosing common or easily cracked passwords.
- **Providing Real-Time Feedback:** If a password is weak, the API returns a message guiding the user to create a stronger one.

### Example of Password Entropy Validation
```go
const minEntropyBits = 60
err := passwordvalidator.Validate(password, minEntropyBits)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("password is too weak: %v", err)
}
```

By enforcing **entropy-based validation**, UniBazaar prevents users from choosing weak passwords while maintaining usability.

---

## 4. OTP Generation & Security Measures
To enhance authentication security, UniBazaar uses a **random 6-digit OTP** for email verification and password reset.

- **Generated Using Cryptographic Randomness:** The OTP is created using Go's `crypto/rand` package to ensure unpredictability.
- **Short Expiry Time:** OTP codes expire within a limited time window (e.g., 5 minutes) to reduce brute-force attempts.
- **Failure Tracking & Lockout Mechanism:** If a user enters an incorrect OTP multiple times (3 or more failures), the system sends a **security alert email**.


This ensures **OTP codes are unique, secure, and difficult to guess**, enhancing authentication security.

---
## 5. JWT-Based Authentication
Sprint 3 introduced JWT endpoints to improve session management and stateless authentication:

- **JWT Generation:** The GetJWTHandler endpoint creates a signed token embedding user data. Tokens are generated using a secret stored in an environment variable.

- **JWT Verification:** The VerifyJWTHandler validates tokens and extracts user information. It checks that the token hasn’t been revoked via a global in-memory revocation map.

- **Token Revocation (Logout):** The LogoutHandler revokes the current token by marking its unique identifier (jti) as invalid, ensuring that a logged-out token cannot be reused.

- **Security Considerations:** JWT tokens are signed with HS256, and their expiry and issuance times (iat/exp) are enforced to prevent replay and timing attacks.
---

## Conclusion
These security measures were carefully chosen to **protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure system integrity**. 
- **Argon2id** provides robust password protection against brute force attacks.
- **SendGrid** ensures reliable OTP delivery with built-in monitoring and security features.
- **Password entropy validation** enforces strong credentials to mitigate password-based attacks.
- **OTP generation and validation** mechanisms enhance security while ensuring user convenience.
- **Error Handling** robust error handling and login/signup flow.
- **JWT functionality** enhances session management by enabling secure token generation, validation, and revocation. This stateless approach reduces server load while maintaining strong security practices.


By implementing these industry-standard best practices, UniBazaar ensures a **secure, scalable, and resilient** authentication system.

  }
]
```

---

## 5. Data Models

### `Message`
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "sender_id": 1,
  "receiver_id": 2,
  "content": "Hello! How are you?",
  "timestamp": 1700000000,
  "read": false
}
```

### `User`
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

---

## 6. Repository Functions

### `SaveMessage(msg models.Message) error`
- Inserts a new message into the database.

### `GetLatestMessages(limit int) ([]models.Message, error)`
- Retrieves the latest messages up to the specified limit.

### `MarkMessageAsRead(messageID int) error`
- Updates a message as read.

### `GetUnreadMessages(userID uint) ([]models.Message, error)`
- Fetches all unread messages for a user.

### `GetConversation(user1ID uint, user2ID uint) ([]models.Message, error)`
- Retrieves all messages where either user is the sender or receiver in the conversation.

---

## 7. Offline Message Handling

- **Offline Messages**: When a user connects, all unread messages are sent to the client.
- **Automatic Marking of Read Messages**: Once the user receives offline messages, they are automatically marked as read in the database.
- **Improvement in Sprint 3**: The system has been optimized to handle both online and offline message sending more efficiently.

---

## 8. AWS Migration

### Database Migration to AWS RDS
The database for the messaging system was migrated from a local PostgreSQL instance to Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. The migration process includes the following steps:

1. **Setting Up RDS Instance**:
   - Create an RDS PostgreSQL instance via the AWS Management Console.
   - Configure the instance with appropriate settings, such as instance type, storage, and VPC configuration.

2. **Database Configuration**:
   - Adjust connection settings to connect to the AWS RDS instance, including the RDS endpoint, database name, username, and password.
   - Update environment variables or configuration files to use the RDS database instance instead of the local database.

3. **Data Migration**:
   - Dump the local PostgreSQL database using `pg_dump` or a similar tool.
   - Use `pg_restore` to import the data into the new RDS PostgreSQL instance.

4. **Security Configuration**:
   - Set up proper IAM roles and security groups to restrict access to the RDS instance.
   - Ensure the application can connect to the RDS instance via secure channels (SSL/TLS) to protect data in transit.

### WebSocket Deployment to AWS
1. **Using AWS EC2**:
   - Deploy the WebSocket server on an EC2 instance to handle real-time messaging.
   - Choose an EC2 instance type appropriate for the expected traffic.
   - Configure security groups to allow WebSocket connections on the necessary port.

2. **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**:
   - Set up an ELB in front of the WebSocket server to distribute traffic and handle failover in case of instance failure.
   - Configure the WebSocket client to reconnect automatically if the connection drops or fails over to another instance.

3. **Auto Scaling**:
   - Set up Auto Scaling on the EC2 instances to handle varying loads of WebSocket connections dynamically.
   - Adjust the scaling policies based on the number of active WebSocket connections or other metrics like CPU utilization.

### S3 for File Storage (Optional)
For storing media files or attachments sent in messages, AWS S3 can be used. Steps for integration:
1. **Set Up S3 Bucket**:
   - Create an S3 bucket with proper access permissions.
   - Configure the system to upload attachments (e.g., images or documents) to S3.

2. **File Handling**:
   - Adjust the messaging API to include file upload functionality, storing files directly in S3 and referencing their URLs in message payloads.

---

## 9. Conclusion
This API facilitates real-time and stored messaging functionalities through WebSockets and REST endpoints, enabling seamless communication between users. Sprint 3 improvements have enhanced the offline message management and WebSocket connection handling, making the system more resilient and efficient in real-world usage scenarios. The migration to AWS provides scalability, availability, and reliability for the system, ensuring high-performance messaging capabilities even under varying loads. Conversations are preserved even if users experience network disruptions, ensuring a smooth user experience across different states of connectivity.
